=== USE ===
This is a very simple bash script for processing file requests with binkd 
on a linux box.
It supports regular files and file-magics.


=== SETUP ===
1. Change the line starting with "CONF" in the script to reflect the place 
   you'll actually put your *.conf files
2. Put your *.conf files to that place and edit them. You'll find examples
   inside..
3. Put the .sh file somewhere adequate and make it executable for the user
   running binkd.
4. Edit your binkd.cfg and add a line like this:
   exec "/usr/local/bin/bashreq.sh *S" *.req


=== WARNING ===
This is very early alpha for now and it will probably be forever. I just 
put this together for my own personal needs and for now, this is sufficient..


=== LICENCE ===
Oh, c'mon..! ;)
