I'm running a BBS using MysticBBS (http://mysticbbs.com) on a Linux Box.
That's enough of a reason for me to code many tiny, little , more or less 
useful scripts for many different purposes.
Most of them are plain crap, but they do their job for me and some of them 
might actually help some other sysops, too - so I put them up here and in 
my BBS, of course:
